/**
 * Marks every per-theme asset stale when core rebuilds the shared one,
 * and gets them rebuilt in the background if this forum can.
 *
 * 🚨 Without this the theme sheets go stale and stay stale. Core's
 * `RecompileFrontendAssets` only rebuilds the asset sets registered with the
 * `AssetManager` — forum, admin, common — so a theme stylesheet built here is
 * invisible to it: enabling an extension rebuilds `forum.css` and leaves every
 * theme sheet on its old revision, indefinitely. Proved on the dev forum —
 * enabling Armory put 42 of its rules into forum.css and none into either
 * theme sheet.
 *
 * Marking rather than deleting is deliberate: `RevisionCompiler::commit()`
 * hashes the compiled output, so a rebuild that changes nothing leaves the
 * revision alone and every member keeps the copy already in their browser.
 * Deleting would hand all of them a new URL and a fresh ~70 KB download for
 * byte-identical CSS.
